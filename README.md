# 🚀 Project 4: Asteroid Rally

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, I aimed to:
- Implement non-trivial Java classes from scratch
- Use a class diagram to guide the implementation process
- Understand object interactions through game development
- Apply mathematical reasoning to simulate motion and collision

---

## 🎮 Playing the Game

The game is a two-player experience inspired by the 1979 Atari classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). Use the on-screen instructions to play solo or with a housemate.

## 🧠 Overview

This project provided partial source code. The task was to:
- Implement missing core classes (`Extent`, `Flag`, `Ship`)
- Complete the `AsteroidRallyModel` to control the game logic

## 🧩 Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](https://storage.googleapis.com/142-files/asteroid.png)

- ✅ Shaded classes provided and not to be modified  
- 🔧 Half-shaded class `AsteroidRallyModel` required partial implementation  
- 🛠️ Remaining classes built from scratch using this diagram and test feedback
---

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes

### Implementation Process
1. Carefully studied `AsteroidRally` and `AsteroidRallyModel`
2. Created skeletons for missing classes (`Flag`, `Ship`, `Extent`)
3. Gradually implemented each class using test-driven development
4. Debugged and refined motion, collision, and gameplay logic

## 🎁 Features Added

- 🧾 **Scoreboard**: Keeps track of scores during gameplay
- 🛑 **Braking Mechanic**: Allows ships to slow down when specific keys are pressed

These enhancements add more depth to the gameplay and improve player control.
